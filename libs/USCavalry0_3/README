Velocity->FreeMarker conversion tool, v. 0.3
(codename: U.S. Cavalry)

The accompanying cavalry.jar is an executable jar file.
You can launch it via:

java -jar cavalry.jar <fromfile> <tofile>

If the <tofile> is not specified, it will output to 
stdout.

CAVEATS:

Certain constructs in Vel will translate to the 
FreeMarker syntax, but are not valid. 

#set (foo-bar = "foobar")

will be translated to:

<#assign foo-bar = "foobar">

but this is actually illegal in FM, since foo-bar 
is not a valid identifier in FM.

In general, the tool generates FTL (FreeMarker Template language)
code that is compatible with FreeMarker 2.1 and higher. 
By contrast with the previous 2 versions of this tool, the FTL
generated is so-called "strict syntax" where the directives
start with a #. So, it generates:

<#if x == y>....</#if>

Note that this syntax only works in FreeMarker 2.1 and later.

Note that certain interpolations are not handled, such as 
putting velocimacros within double-quoted strings, i.e.

"blah blah #mymacro(blah) blah blah"

FreeMarker now has an "interpret" transform that allows the
equivalent to this, but US Cavalry does not currently
translate to that construct. You'd have to do it by
hand. Maybe in a later version.

Needless to say, this tool does not convert your 
java source code over. You have to do that yourself. 
You will almost certainly have some work ahead of you 
to port your app. 

However, note that there is an included utility class, 
com.revusky.util.FreeMarker that exposes an API rather 
similar to the  org.apache.velocity.Velocity.mergeTemplate() 
routine. This is basically just a convenience to
help you get going quickly. Note that this works against
the FreeMarker 2.1 API. 

The enclosed .jar file is actually a modified version
of Velocity itself. It uses the same code to build
the tree and I have added a custom dump method to the
various nodes in the syntax tree, so that the tree can 
be dumped out in FreeMarker syntax. That's how it works. 
Note that I am also including the source of the launching
class (com.revusky.util.USCavalry) so that you can 
customize it.

This tool is not perfect, but is certainly good 
enough to be very useful. Please send feedback to 
freemarker-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
